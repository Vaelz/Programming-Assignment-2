## Normalization Problem
In this problem, I started with importing numpy as np to use the functions of numpy.

After that I set X to contain random number output code "np.random.rand" the inset the size to "5,5" to create a 5x5 array

Then to compute for the mean an standard deviation i used the functions "X.mean" and "X.std" then put them in a variable named X_mean and X_std.
After that i used the variables to normalize the variable X using the formula (X_normalized = (X - X_mean) / X_std).

To save the the X_normalized i used the function "np.save" to save it into npy.

To check for the out put i just used the print function to get a preview of the normalized value.
